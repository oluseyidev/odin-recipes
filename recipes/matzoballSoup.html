    <p>Whether you're making a pot for Passover or just because you feel like it, there's nothing quite like a bowl of warm and cozy matzo (or matzah) ball soup</p>
    <p> The Jewish soup with dumplings — traditionally made with matzah meal, eggs, water, and a fat — is about as comforting as it gets.</p>

    <h2>Ingrdients</h2>
    <ul>Turkey Broth:
       <li>3 pounds roasted turkey bones and meat scraps, the fattier the better </li>
       <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
       <li>2 ribs celery, chopped</li>
       <li>2 quarts water or chicken broth, or more to cover bones</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Soup:
        <li>2 tablespoons rendered melted turkey fat</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 cups homemade rich turkey broth or chicken broth</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablesponn chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place leftover turkey (meat, bones, skin) into a stock pot. Add 1 chopped onion and 2 ribs chopped celery and water or chicken broth (or half of each). Bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce heat to low and continue to cook at a low simmer. Skim off scum as it forms, but don't remove any fat. Cook until broth is rich and any turkey meat has been rendered flavorless, about 3 hours. While broth cooks, skim off fat as it rises to the surface and save it in a bowl. Save about 4 tablespoons turkey fat.</li>
        <li>After removing surface fat, strain broth into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Lightly whisk 2 eggs in a separate mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons cooled rendered turkey fat and whisk to mix. Whisk in salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix in seltzer water. Add matzo meal and mix with a fork until mixture begins to thicken up, 1 or 2 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons turkey fat in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1 cup diced onions, 1/2 cup diced carrots, 1/2 cup diced celery, and salt. Cook until onions start to turn translucent, 6 or 7 minutes. Add sliced garlic and cook an additional minute. Add turkey broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Check seasoning and adjust salt, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Divide matzo ball dough into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball using your wet hands.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted cold water to a boil. Gently place matzo balls into the boiling water. Reduce heat so they simmer gently; cover the pot. Simmer until matzo balls are cooked through, about 30 minutes, adjusting heat as they cook so a gentle simmer continues. Transfer to hot serving bowls, 2 per serving.</li>
        <li>Stir freshly chopped parsley and dill into soup. Ladle hot soup over the matzo balls.</li>
    </ol>
